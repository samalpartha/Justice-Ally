# JusticeAlly: The AI Litigation Strategist

In the US, **92% of civil legal needs** for low-income Americans go unmet. Millions fail in court annually not from a lack of truth, but a crushing lack of procedure. **JusticeAlly** bridges this divide by transforming **Gemini 3.0 Pro** into an elite *AI Litigation Strategist*—an always-available, high-fidelity legal co-pilot that turns chaos into strategy and panic into decisive action.

## Multi-Model Architecture
We orchestrate a symphony of specialized Gemini models to deliver institutional-grade legal reasoning:
*   **Gemini 2.5 Flash (Triage):** Instantly calculates procedural risk scores, financial exposure, and jurisdictional viability—filtering unfit cases before they clog overburdened court dockets.
*   **Gemini 3.0 Pro (War Room):** Deeply maps evidence and chaotic narratives to specific “Black Letter Law” elements (Duty, Breach, Causation), generating professional litigation strategies previously accessible only to the wealthy elite.
*   **Gemini Live (Simulation):** Acts as a low-latency real-time voice adversary, enabling users to rehearse oral arguments and negotiation tactics under simulated courtroom pressure.

## Engineering & Privacy
Developed through the rapid **“Vibe Coding”** methodology in Google AI Studio, JusticeAlly compresses months of complex engineering into hours while maintaining enterprise-grade reliability. Crucially, it pioneers a **Local-First Privacy Architecture**, ensuring that all sensitive client data remains encrypted strictly within the browser and never persists on external servers.

JusticeAlly embodies a bold new frontier—**AI-assisted procedural justice**—empowering the 50 million Americans who face the legal system without representation. By merging universal accessibility, profound reasoning depth, and ethical AI design, it proves that a single developer can engineer institutional-scale impact to dismantle one of society’s most persistent inequities.
