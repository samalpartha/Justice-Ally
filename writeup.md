# JusticeAlly: Bridging the 92% Justice Gap with Gemini 3 Pro

## The Crisis
In the US, **92% of civil legal needs** for low-income Americans go unmet. Millions of "pro se" litigants lose meaningful cases every year—not because they lack facts, but because they lack procedure. The legal system is pay-to-play, and most cannot pay.

## The Solution
**JusticeAlly** is a Force Multiplier for the unrepresented. It transforms the **Gemini 3.0 Pro** API into a Senior Litigation Strategist. Unlike generic chatbots, JusticeAlly provides a structured, secure "War Room" for strategy, evidence management, and risk assessment, moving users from panic to action.

## Powered by Gemini 3.0 Pro
We leveraged Gemini 3.0 Pro’s advanced reasoning and massive context window to ingest state procedural codes and analyze complex multimodal evidence (PDFs, bodycam footage, audio).
*   **Triage Module:** Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash for instant risk scoring, preventing futile lawsuits before they clog the courts.
*   **War Room:** Uses **Gemini 3.0 Pro** to map chaotic facts to "Black Letter Law" elements (Duty, Breach, Causation), reducing case preparation time by **90%** (from weeks to minutes).
*   **Live Strategy:** Uses **Gemini Live** for real-time oral argument simulation, allowing litigants to rehearse before stepping into court.

## Vibe-Coding with Google AI Studio
This platform was built using **Google AI Studio**'s "Vibe Coding" methodology. By iterating via natural language prompts within the IDE, we bypassed weeks of boilerplate engineering. This allowed us to focus purely on high-fidelity UX and legal logic, proving that with Gemini, a single developer can build institutional-grade tools that democratize access to justice for the 50 million Americans navigating the courts alone annually.
